# PS4-RDR-2-Menu-Base
A mod menu GUI for PS4 RDR 2


A (very basic) mod menu GUI based on 2much4u's [PS4 GTA V Menu Base](https://github.com/2much4u/PS4-GTA-V-Menu-Base).

Requires [Scene Collective/AlAzif's PS4 Payload SDK](https://github.com/Scene-Collective/ps4-payload-sdk) to compile.
Compatible with firmwares 5.05, 6.72, 7.55, and 9.00

**Supports only the 1.29 patch of RDR 2 on both US & EU regions.**

Currently not compatible with GoldHEN's bin loader.

Just as customizable as 2much4u's GTA V Menu Base.

Special thanks to 2much4u, 0x199, AlAzif, and ChendoChap for their assistance.
